## 🚀 About Me

I'm a dedicated **Technical Support Specialist** with hands-on experience in solving complex IT challenges across hardware, software, and network environments. Known for my calm-under-pressure approach and user-first attitude, I’ve handled 50+ support cases weekly — ensuring fast resolution and high customer satisfaction.

Beyond fixing problems, I believe in delivering **clarity, confidence, and continuity** for users. With additional exposure to tools like Power BI and SQL, I bring extra value when tech support intersects with analytics.
